# PokeClone

PokeClone is an educational project that combines the power of a React front-end framework with a Django back-end. This collaborative effort represents the first-time collaboration of the development team, showcasing their collective skills and aspirations in game development. It is important to note that the project is not deployed, and there is no intention for profit or monetary gain. The goal of PokeClone is to provide users with a Pokemon-inspired gaming experience where they can embark on a virtual journey, capture Pokemon, and train them to challenge the Gym leader.
